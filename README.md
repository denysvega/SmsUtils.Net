SMS utils: Utility methods for SMS messages 
Ported from Java: https://github.com/balamaci/sms-utils
=====================================
Small utility library for SMS. Can be used to determine the necessary encoding and in how many sms parts it must be split into multiple sms parts.

Q: What is the max size of a text message that I can send through SMS?

A: Theoretically unlimited, as you can send multiple SMS-es and use part of their contents(a standard header) to specify they are all parts of the same text message. 
Practically the number of SMS **parts** is limited by the SMS provider. Could be 3, 35 or whatever. 


Q: What is the max text size of a single SMS?

A: It depends on the characters in the message. As long at the message contains only characters in the [GSM 03.38]() charset, the max size of a message is 160 characters. 
A bigger text message can be sent by splitting it into multiple sms-es. As said above, a chunk of the message(the [UDS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Data_Header) header) can be used to mark the sms parts as being a sequence of the same message. Therefore the max size of the text drops down to 153.


Should the text contain characters outside **GSM 03.38 charset**, the encoding is changed to **Unicode (UCS-2) UTF-16**. 
The characters in the **GSM 03.38 charset** can be encoded in a **7 bit** per char encoding. 
Since we're using more bytes per each char(16) the maximum number of that can fit in the message is lower. Now only 70 chars fit in a single part sms and 53 for a multipart one.  
This results from: An sms package has 140 bytes(140 * 8 bits) 
GSM 03.38 charset  => 7 bit per char => 140 * 8 / 7 = 160
Unicode            => 16 bits pe char => 140 * 8 / 16 = 70 

### SMS size
|                | Single Part | Multipart |
|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Gsm338 charset | 160         | 153       |
|                |             |           |
| Unicode        |  70         |  67       |


### GSM 03.38 extended charset
Besides the base charset the are a few extra characters(â‚¬, |, {, ..) which still can be encoded as 7 bit, however another character(a by a special escape character _(0x1B)_) must be added before them. This means that the characters from this extended charset count as 2.  
In multipart sms-es at the end of an sms part the sms escape character _0x1B_ cannot stand by itself, so instead a new sms part must be added that will start with the escape char _0x1B_ + '{' for example.

### FAQ

Q: Can a text message be split into multi part SMS-es each part with different encoding? Like 1st part GSM338, 2nd Unicode, etc.

A: No, the whole SMS encoding must be the same. So if have a message with all characters from GSM338 and you add a character not in it (like a greek alphabet) causing the encoding to be switched to Unicode, the size for each part changes and how it's split must be recalculated.
